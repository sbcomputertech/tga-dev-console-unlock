# TGA Dev Console Unlocker
### The console is entirely in the base game! This mod only activates it and puts it on screen

### Usage:
- [Download the zip file](https://github.com/sbcomputertech/tga-dev-console-unlock/releases/download/1.0.0/tga_dev_console.zip)
- Extract all the files into the game folder
- Run the game
- Press F4 to open the console

To uninstall, delete:
- `winhttp.dll`
- `doorstop_config.ini`
- `BepInEx`

from the game folder
